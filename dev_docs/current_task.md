# Current Task: Phase 5 - Testing, Refinement & Documentation

## Context

Phases 1 through 4 are complete. The core application logic, including CSV processing, crawling, concurrency management, file writing, and the main CLI integration, is implemented. The project now enters the final phase focused on testing, refining the implementation, and completing documentation.

## Current Focus

- Project Completion Verification.

## Context Update

- Fixed deprecated `datetime.utcfromtimestamp` method in `src/logger_config.py`.
- All planned coding, testing (initial unit tests), refinement, and documentation tasks are complete.
- User has confirmed completion of GitHub repository creation and initial push.
- **Bug Fix:** Corrected crawler logic in `src/crawler.py` to prevent duplicate URLs.
- **Enhancement:** Added `tqdm` progress bar to `src/crawler.py`.
- **Verification:** User confirmed successful script execution with correct output (no duplicates) and working progress bar after the latest changes. An example map file has been generated.

## Next Steps

1.  **User Action Required:** Commit and push the latest code changes (including `src/crawler.py`, `requirements.txt`, updated Memory Bank files) and the generated example map file (`output_maps/<example>_nav_map.md`) to the GitHub repository.
2.  This action fulfills the final completion criterion from `project_brief.md`. The project is ready for final completion confirmation.
