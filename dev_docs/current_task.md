# Current Task: Phase 5 - Testing, Refinement & Documentation

## Context

Phases 1 through 4 are complete. The core application logic, including CSV processing, crawling, concurrency management, file writing, and the main CLI integration, is implemented. The project now enters the final phase focused on testing, refining the implementation, and completing documentation.

## Current Focus

- **Completed:** Filename generation logic modification.

## Context Update

- **Previous State:** Project was considered complete after final commit and push.
- **New Requirement (2025-03-04):** User requested a change to the output filename generation. Instead of just using the sanitized domain (e.g., `developer_gocardless_com`), the filename should now include the sanitized first path segment as well (e.g., `developer_gocardless_com_api_reference`). This affects the `get_website_name` function in `src/utils.py`.
- **Implementation (2025-03-04):**
  - Updated `dev_docs/implementation_plan.md`.
  - Modified `src/utils.py::get_website_name`.
  - Updated `dev_docs/project_tracker.md`.
  - Updated `CHANGELOG.md`.
  - Reminded user to commit changes.
  - Reviewed Memory Bank post-update.

## Next Steps

- Awaiting user confirmation or further instructions. (User should commit changes).
