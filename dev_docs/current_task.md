# Current Task: Phase 5 - Testing, Refinement & Documentation

## Context

Phases 1 through 4 are complete. The core application logic, including CSV processing, crawling, concurrency management, file writing, and the main CLI integration, is implemented. The project now enters the final phase focused on testing, refining the implementation, and completing documentation.

## Current Focus

- Execute Phase 5, Step 13 from `implementation_plan.md`: GitHub Repository setup.

## Context Update

All planned coding, testing (initial unit tests), refinement, and documentation tasks (Memory Bank updates, README, CHANGELOG, .clineignore) are complete.

## Next Steps

1.  Remind user to create a public GitHub repository.
2.  Remind user to add the remote origin and push the initial commit.
3.  Remind user to manually run the script with a sample CSV to generate at least one example `_nav_map.md` file and commit it before considering the project complete as per the brief's criteria.
4.  Prepare for final completion attempt.
