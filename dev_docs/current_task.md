# Current Task: Initialize Project and Memory Bank

## Context

This is the initial setup phase for the Website Navigation Map generator project. The `project_brief.md` has been established, outlining the goals, requirements, and technical specifications.

## Current Focus

- Create the essential Memory Bank documentation files (`project_brief.md`, `codebase_summary.md`, `tech_stack.md`, `current_task.md`, `project_tracker.md`).
- Establish the initial project structure, including the `dev_docs` directory.

## Next Steps

1.  Create `dev_docs/project_tracker.md`.
2.  Review all created Memory Bank documents for consistency and completeness based on the `project_brief.md`.
3.  Proceed with setting up the basic project file structure (e.g., folders for CSV inputs and markdown outputs) as defined in the brief.
