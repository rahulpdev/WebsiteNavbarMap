# Current Task: Phase 5 - Testing, Refinement & Documentation

## Context

Phases 1 through 4 are complete. The core application logic, including CSV processing, crawling, concurrency management, file writing, and the main CLI integration, is implemented. The project now enters the final phase focused on testing, refining the implementation, and completing documentation.

## Current Focus

- Post-enhancement check before completion.

## Context Update

- Fixed deprecated `datetime.utcfromtimestamp` method in `src/logger_config.py`.
- All planned coding, testing (initial unit tests), refinement, and documentation tasks are complete.
- User has confirmed completion of GitHub repository creation and initial push.
- **Bug Fix:** Corrected crawler logic in `src/crawler.py` to prevent duplicate URLs.
- **Enhancement:** Added `tqdm` progress bar to `src/crawler.py` for visual feedback during crawling. Updated `requirements.txt` and relevant Memory Bank docs (`tech_stack.md`, `codebase_summary.md`, `project_tracker.md`).
- **Bug Fix:** Corrected indentation error in `src/crawler.py` (`continue` outside loop).

## Next Steps

1.  **User Action Required:** Install the new dependency (`tqdm`) using `pip install -r requirements.txt` within the activated virtual environment (if not already done).
2.  **User Action Required:** Manually run the script with a sample CSV to generate at least one example `_nav_map.md` file in `output_maps/`. Verify the progress bar appears and the output is correct.
3.  **User Action Required:** Commit and push the updated code (including `requirements.txt`) and the generated example map file to the GitHub repository to meet the final completion criterion from `project_brief.md`.
4.  Once the example file is generated and pushed, the project can be considered complete.
