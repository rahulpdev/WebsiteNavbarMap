## Using git

- Remind the user to commit coherent changes and suggest concise commit messages.
- Remind the user to verify GitHub Actions when appropriate.
- Add sensitive configuration files, data files (e.g., .csv, .xlsx) and auto-generated files, build artifacts, and other non-essential content to the .gitignore file (create if it doesnâ€™t exist).
