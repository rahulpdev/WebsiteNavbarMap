# Current Task: Phase 5 - Testing, Refinement & Documentation

## Context

Phases 1 through 4 are complete. The core application logic, including CSV processing, crawling, concurrency management, file writing, and the main CLI integration, is implemented. The project now enters the final phase focused on testing, refining the implementation, and completing documentation.

## Current Focus

- Final check before completion.

## Context Update

- Fixed deprecated `datetime.utcfromtimestamp` method in `src/logger_config.py`.
- All planned coding, testing (initial unit tests), refinement, and documentation tasks are complete.
- User has confirmed completion of GitHub repository creation and initial push.

## Next Steps

1.  **User Action Required:** Manually run the script with a sample CSV to generate at least one example `_nav_map.md` file in `output_maps/`. Commit and push this file to the GitHub repository to meet the final completion criterion from `project_brief.md`.
2.  Once the example file is generated and pushed, the project can be considered complete.
